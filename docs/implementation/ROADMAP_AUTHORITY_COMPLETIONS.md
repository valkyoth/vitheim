# Roadmap Authority And Recovery Completions

Document status: normative implementation handoffs

This focused stop owns authority-bearing execution and recovery that is
deliberately separate from the declarative domain-retirement contract. It does
not weaken the lifecycle, drainage, history, disposition, or certification
obligations owned elsewhere.

## `0.30.29` — Domain Retirement Authority And Crash Recovery

Status: planned.
Setup: consume the `0.30.28` lifecycle and prospective contract; define typed
`DomainRetirementScopeV1` as exactly `TenantDomainData { deployment_id,
tenant_id, domain_id }` or `DeploymentDomain { deployment_id, domain_id,
membership_snapshot }`, never an optional/wildcard tenant. Define
`DomainRetirementProposalV1` with immutable plan digest, expected manifest and
contribution generations, expected retirement-state version, idempotency
identity, current authorization, separated proposer/approver/destructive
approver identities, and approval expiry. This stop executes only the exact
tenant child; deployment scope requires `0.51.5–0.51.6`.
Goal: execute and recover retirement transitions without stale authority,
partial commitment, silent command reopening, or data-loss acceptance becoming
completion authority.
Deliverables: closed scope, proposal/approval/plan codecs, expected-version admission,
authority and separation-of-duties checks, atomic state/audit/outbox commitment,
pre-fence cancellation, authorized quiescing abort/recovery, bounded resume
protocol, and typed `Blocked`/`EvidenceUnavailable` evidence.
Verification: domain/deployment/tenant, plan digest, manifest/contribution
generation, expected version, idempotency, principal, quorum, approval, or
expiry substitution; self-approval; duplicate/concurrent execution; crash and
response loss at every transition and audit/outbox boundary; cancellation after
fencing; unauthorized abort; resume that reopens fenced commands; stale work or
quarantine ignored; forced completion by accepting data loss; false authority-
loss/data-loss evidence; optional/wildcard tenant; deployment scope executed as
one child or cross-tenant transaction; and restore of an earlier state pass.
Exit criteria: every retry joins the same immutable plan and resumes only from
its durable fenced state; cancellation is possible only before fencing, later
recovery requires current separated authority, and completion records only an
exact `0.30.28` terminal. `RetiredVerified` alone is clean;
`RetiredWithIrrecoverableLoss`, `RetirementBlocked`, and `EvidenceUnavailable`
remain permanent non-clean outcomes in audit, support state, restore/import,
risk, and administration. Recording loss grants no deletion or hold-release
authority and erases no residual obligation.

## `0.51.5` — Deployment Tenant-Membership Retirement Cut

Status: planned.
Setup: consume the authoritative `0.51.1` tenant lifecycle/topology and
an authorized `DeploymentRetirementMembershipCutRequestV1` binding exact
deployment/domain; produce the membership snapshot required by the `0.30.29`
deployment scope. Reuse the sealed-generation, delivery-barrier, fenced-move,
durable-cursor, and reconciliation laws established for bounded campaigns
rather than treating a projection as membership authority.
Goal: freeze one authenticated, complete deployment tenant-membership cut for a
domain without a cross-tenant transaction or losing tenants created, migrated,
moved, or discovered around that cut.
Deliverables: `DeploymentTenantMembershipCutV1` identity/generation/digest,
bounded authenticated member chunks, source high-watermarks and final barrier,
creation/migration/move fence and handoff receipts, monotonic snapshot cursor,
late-member reconciliation, restore ratchet, and visible blocked-member report.
Verification: omitted/duplicate/substituted tenant, forged or stale digest,
projection-as-authority, cut versus tenant create/migrate/move, lost handoff,
late discovery, incomplete barrier, cursor/generation rollback after restore,
cross-deployment/domain reuse, unbounded enumeration, and hidden blocked member
pass.
Exit criteria: the cut accounts for every authoritative tenant membership
through its authenticated high-watermarks, and every around-cut mutation is
either correctly included, explicitly post-cut with a fenced handoff, or a
visible reconciliation blocker. It grants no tenant retirement authority.

## `0.51.6` — Deployment-Wide Domain Retirement Campaign

Status: planned.
Setup: consume one current `0.51.5` membership cut, `0.30.29` exact tenant-child
authority/recovery, `0.30.28` orthogonal evidence dimensions and terminals,
tenant-specific legal-hold/disposition policy, and durable quota/fairness/
recovery-capacity contracts.
Goal: retire one domain across a deployment through isolated tenant children
without wildcard authority, shared mutable child state, or a cross-tenant
transaction.
Deliverables: durable parent campaign with monotonic generation/cursor, bounded
batch/concurrency/storage/work budgets, protected recovery lane and fairness,
one idempotent child identity/result receipt per member, tenant-specific hold/
disposition decision, late-member reconciliation, terminal result manifest,
blocked-member report, and restore/restart protocol.
Verification: tenant omitted from membership, tenant created/moved across the
cut, child request/result substituted across tenants, duplicate child,
cross-tenant transaction/shared state, parent completion with missing/blocked/
unresolved child, campaign cursor/generation rollback, crash/reorder/retry,
one-large-tenant starvation, recovery-capacity borrowing, unbounded result
retention, and loss terminal presented as clean pass.
Exit criteria: every snapshot member has exactly one tenant-isolated terminal
child receipt and every late member is reconciled before parent completion;
blocked, evidence-unavailable, quarantined, unresolved, and loss outcomes remain
explicit per tenant and in the parent aggregate. Only an all-`RetiredVerified`
manifest satisfies a clean deployment-domain retirement claim.

## `0.145.4` — Domain Retirement And Historical Compatibility Certification

Status: planned.
Setup: consume `0.30.28` retirement contracts, `0.30.29` authority/recovery
protocol and evidence, applicable `0.51.5–0.51.6` deployment campaigns, current
domain/contribution generations, `0.145.3` lifecycle/recovery evidence,
installed-extension state, cross-domain dependencies, outstanding durable work,
retained event/snapshot/export/backup/import history, deferrals, and product state.
Goal: destructively certify selected-profile domain/module/plugin retirement
and reinstall while preserving every retained historical obligation.
Deliverables: retirement/drain exercise corpus, dependency-closure and
outstanding-work report, proposal/approval/plan and command/effect-fence
evidence, membership/cut/cursor/fairness and terminal-manifest evidence,
data-disposition/legal-hold proof, codec/upcaster retention set, historical
read/restore/import matrix, reinstall/rollback-floor matrix, and certification report.
Verification: stale or unauthorized retirement plan, crash-resume divergence,
command reopening, forced data-loss acceptance, false authority/data evidence,
tenant omitted from campaign membership, create/move across campaign cut,
cross-tenant child-result substitution, completion with blocked/unresolved
child, campaign cursor rollback, large-tenant fairness starvation, loss terminal
presented as clean, late command/effect, undrained work, dangling reference,
codec loss, premature deletion, hold/export/erasure bypass, backup/restore/
import failure, uninstall data loss, ID reuse, unsafe downgrade, unresolved
defer, false support, and late implementation pass.
Exit criteria: every selected retirement either completes with closed authority,
drained/disposed work, truthful per-dimension and per-tenant evidence, permanent
ID tombstone, readable retained history, and safe reinstall floor, or retains
its exact non-clean/blocking result; the certifier adds no missing retirement,
campaign, authority, recovery, codec, lifecycle, or reconciliation behavior.
